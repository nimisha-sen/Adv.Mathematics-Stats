#### Element 1 Part 1

##### a. What is the task about?
This mini project involves analyzing the relationship between mobile usage patterns and motor skills. The main objective is to understand how the duration and type of mobile usage might impact an individual's motor skills. The project is structured into sub-tasks including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling.

##### b. What Maths and Statistics involved?
Mathematics and statistics play a crucial role in this project. Descriptive statistics are used to summarize and understand the distribution of variables. Correlation analysis is employed to explore relationships between mobile usage and motor skills. Predictive modeling involves regression analysis, leveraging concepts of linear regression to predict motor skills based on mobile usage patterns.

##### c. How did you implement?
Libraries like Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and scikit-learn for machine learning tasks were used. Logic involved cleaning data, handling missing values, and applying appropriate statistical tests. Regression models were implemented to predict motor skills based on mobile usage, considering factors like duration and type of usage.

##### d. Outcomes of each sub-task
Data preprocessing ensured a clean dataset for analysis. Exploratory data analysis revealed insights into mobile usage patterns. Statistical analysis confirmed significant correlations. Predictive modeling provided a regression equation to predict motor skills.

##### e. Challenges and How you resolved?
Challenges included missing data and outliers. Imputation strategies were used for missing data, and outliers were handled through robust statistical techniques. Model performance challenges were addressed by fine-tuning parameters and exploring alternative algorithms.

##### f. References
References include literature on the impact of screen time on motor skills, statistical methodologies used, and documentation of libraries and packages employed in the analysis.
This mini project provides a comprehensive understanding of the intricate relationship between mobile usage and motor skills, offering valuable insights for future studies in the field.
